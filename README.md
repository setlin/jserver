'jserver' meas jielin server. 'Jielin' is my Chinese name.

Jserver is a kind of Linux high-performance server, with 3 important part.
[1]buffer;
[2]net pool;
[3]memory database.


'jserver' is my graduation project, thanks to my workmate hanxi, he teached me so much. He guided me how to
form a network server.

The most of codes and documents are from his test, what I did was learning from his codes, and repaired some bugs.

The memory database is my own study, I use STL to help me.

Thanks for reading.

If you find some bugs, please tell me, let's grow up together^_^
